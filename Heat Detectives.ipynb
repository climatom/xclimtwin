    "# ESR Workshop: Being a Heatwave Detective \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guided practical work you will be characterising a deadly heatwave and playing a detective to diagnose its drivers. The end result should be a brief PowerPoint presentation that you will provide to the group, providing a forensic \"anatomy\" of the heatwave. Your assessment should cover the items listed in the Objectives (below), which can be achieved by following all the instructions provided in this notebook. Make sure you read everything carefully and **ask if you are unsure** (via live messaging with Tom). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify a deadly heatwave from history \n",
    "2. Characterise the deadly heat wave in terms of its temperature and humidity\n",
    "3. Explain the drivers of the extreme heat event using Lagrangian methods\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read all about the HadISD product here: https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadisd/. Briefly, it is a global, sub-daily and quality-controlled dataset based on the integrated surface database (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/isd).  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using this 'notebook'\n",
    "\n",
    "This 'notebook' is made up of text cells (like this one) and code cells (like the one below). The code cells can be 'run' by first clicking in that cell with your mouse, and then pressing the 'ctrl' key and the 'enter' key at the same time. This causes the python interpreter to read and execute the code. Note that you can also run a code cell by clicking in it, and then clicking on the 'run' icon at the top of this browser window.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You should follow this notebook by reading the text cells, and running the code cells -- but only when you come to them. The notebook is like a story, and they code should be run at the 'right' time to make sense. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there are also 'comments' (denoted with the '#' character) in the code cells to draw attention to what each section is doing. Please read the comments carefully to help you understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, then, run the code cell below. It sets up our analysis session by importing relevant python 'modules' and defining useful functions. Note that most of these functions are used to calculate humid heat measures from the raw weather station observations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**NB: to 'run' the code cell, you just need to click in it with your mouse, and then press the 'ctrl' key and the 'enter' key at the same time.**\n"

    "## Identifying your target heatwave for analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "I have processed a sample of events from the [Emergency Database](https://www.emdat.be/), selecting all heatwaves with detailed enough meta-data for you to examine their physical drivers (i.e., identify precisely when and where they occurred). The sample is available for viewing [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1557Ff-r_fHosjmHk2H-G4nceJfhjqbWjY776x1603yA/edit#gid=0). Please access that spreadsheet and **select a heatwave that you want to study**: note down when and where it occurred. For the latter, you will need to convert the place name in the \"Geo Locations\" column to a lat/lon coordinate in decimal degrees. Googling is fine for this -- perhaps with some detective work to refine the location and understanding of what happened in the event. For example, the 2015 heatwave in Punjab and Sindh killed many in Karachi -- as revealed by a Google search of \"2015 heatwave Sindh\". If you were interested in this event, using the lat/lon for Karachi would be the best way to proceed with the analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accessing weather station data during your heatwave\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have selected a heatwave to study, we are ready to download weather station data to inspect the heat during the event. We will do this programmatically. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code below reads the metadata file (called 'hadisd.csv') which should be saved in the same directory as this notebook. It then computes the distance between a 'query point' and each station, evaluating the great circle distance (defined by the 'distance' function above) between pairs of latitude/longitudes. The closest weather station is then selected, and downloaded as a zip file from the [Met Office website](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadisd/), which is subsequently unzipped and read in as a netCDF4 file, before being parsed into a [pandas DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) called 'recent'. This is a very powerful and convenient format for further analysis. We then check availability of both air temperature and depowint temperature during the heatwave period. Only if there is more then 50 % of data available do we accept the station's record; otherwise we go to the next closest station, and so on until finding a record that is complete enough. \n",
    "\n",
    "The latitude/longitude you select for query_lat/query_lon will determine which weather station is downloaded from the HadISD archive (i.e., which is the closest match). **You will need to change these to the 'epicentre' of your chosen extreme heat event** (as explained under the section above -- about identifying a heatwave for analysis). \n",
    "\n",
    "You will also need to edit hw_st and hw_stp to ensure that we search for the right period. When editing these to reflect *your* heat wave period, please **pay close attention to how the start/stop dates are formatted\". \n",

    "## Heatwave drivers\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in the lecture, the 'weather' is always the immediate driver of extreme heat events: clear skies enabling powerful solar heating of the land can pump heat into the boundary layer via the surface heat fluxes; heat can also be advected (\"blown in\") by favourable winds, with subsidence also possibly amplifying the sensible heat content. Where, then, did the air come from during your selected heatwave? We can assess this now using NOAA's [Hysplit model](https://www.ready.noaa.gov/HYSPLIT.php). The instructions for how to set the model up are provided in [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_UZrl8s92c8d_HivmNZNRRahmqEiN7O2C09tiN5MEEo/edit#) Google Doc.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should follow the instuctions so that you can explain to the group what caused the heat wave. Note that due to constraints with Hysplit, you will have to focus mostly on the sesible heat content; but if the air packets travelled over warm water before reaching the heat wave location -- and if the heatwave was characterised by extreme latent heat content -- it would be reasonable to assume that the journey over warm water could have been an important driver of the extreme event. \n",

    "**Remember to direct any questions to Tom if you are unsure about what to do here.** \n",

    "## Presenting your findings for discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Although you are free to present in any way you like, I suggest the following structure would work: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Slide 1: Overview of selected heatwave -- where, when, and impact. \n",
    "- Slide 2: Meteorology during the event -- was it a dry or humid heatwave?\n",
    "- Slide 3 - end (taking as many as you want, but within reason!): Hysplit analysis, with a synthesis/interpretation identifying the main drivers\n",
    "\n",
